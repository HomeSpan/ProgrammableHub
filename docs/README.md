# ProgrammableHub - A HomeSpan Project

ProgrammableHub is a working example of how to add a Web Server alongside of HomeSpan to create a Programmable Light Server Hub.  Built using the [HomeSpan](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan) HomeKit Library, ProgrammableHub is designed to run on an ESP32 device as an Arduino sketch.  

Hardware used for this project:

* An ESP32 board, such as the [Adafruit HUZZAH32 â€“ ESP32 Feather Board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405)
* One or more LEDs with current-limiting resistors

## Operation

TBD
